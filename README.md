# Multifunctional Desk Lamp with Versatile Lighting and Modern Connectivity

This project presents the design and development of a **smart multifunctional desk lamp** that responds to ambient light conditions by automatically switching on in low-light environments and turning off when sufficient light is detected.  

It integrates features such as USB charging ports, a built-in rechargeable battery, and adjustable brightness levels to provide both energy efficiency and user convenience.
